# About me

I am **19 years old**, I am a student at ***BOISE STATE UNIVERSITY*** I study <ins>Computer Engineering</ins> there and am a *2nd year* student as of right now. I fill my days working on school work, hanging out with my girlfriend of <ins>**3 years**</ins>, hanging out with my family on occasion, playing video games, and working. I **LOVE** working with and on computers, they just facinate me so much when I am working on the inside of them. I really enjoy taking things apart and putting them together.
