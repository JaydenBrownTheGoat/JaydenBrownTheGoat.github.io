# Welcome

I welcome you to my homepage, here you can find out lots of things about me (The creator) and things that I've made. I hope you'll enjoy learning.

## Learning about me

The best way to learn about me would be to go to my [About me](aboutme.md) page and read through that but what that doesn't cover is what you'll find out in this next section which is about the things that I really enjoy doing.

## Things I Enjoy

I love working on computers not just because they facinate me but also because they are so cool and fun to take apart and look at. I used to work at the helpdesk at my highschool where I would:
* Interact with people who needed help.
* Help people submit tickets to our system (HappyFox).
* Give written tickets to the "teacher" (I say "teacher" because she was there to observe and do all the things we can't do but wasn't really there to teach, just there to set in when needed).
* Diagnose issues with the Chromebooks.
* Fix issues with the Chromebooks unless it was a motherboard issue in that case it was a longer process.
* Close the tickets.

With all of that said my favorite part of all of that was the fixing of the computers because it was so fun to take apart the computer and in my head remember everything that I need to do and everything that I need to do to put it all back together. That is one of my hobbies but another would be playing video games, I love playing video games and trying out all kinds, my favorite right now would have to be [Seven Deadly Sins: Orignin](https://7origin.netmarble.com/en?utm_source=google_sa_US&utm_campaign=google_sa&utm_medium=brand&utm_content=US&utm_term=seven%2Bdeadly%2Bsins%3A%2Borigin&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=23491482605&gclid=CjwKCAiA-sXMBhAOEiwAGGw6LCy--GjoL89wv-uDBRdSSsRfS3gV7NJg4c1IVbZdrpmMCYOXLzaLyBoC1VQQAvD_BwE) which isn't coming out until March 16 for PS5 (playstation 5) and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3679080/The_Seven_Deadly_Sins_Origin/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=23491482605&gclid=CjwKCAiA-sXMBhAOEiwAGGw6LCy--GjoL89wv-uDBRdSSsRfS3gV7NJg4c1IVbZdrpmMCYOXLzaLyBoC1VQQAvD_BwE) but I am super exicted for the game an I can already tell it's going to be my new favorite. Another thing I enjoy doing is spending time with loved ones aka my family, my best friend, and my girlfriend of 3 years.

## Creations

If you want to learn more about me the best way is through my creations and attempted personal creations. I have a [page](creations.md) about just that with that link. You can find out all about my creations and what they do along with my personal creations that I am working on and what they're meant to do.

## The End
I hope you enjoyed learning about me and I hope you have a good day.
