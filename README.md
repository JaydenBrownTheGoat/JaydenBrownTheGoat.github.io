# Welcome

I welcome you to my homepage, here you can find out lots of things about me (The creator) and things that I've made. I hope you'll enjoy learning.

## Learning about me

The best way to learn about me would be to go to my [About me](aboutme.md) page and read through that but what that doesn't cover is what you'll find out in this next section which is about the things that I really enjoy doing.

## Creations

If you want to learn more about me the best way is through my creations and attempted personal creations. I have a [page](creations.md) about just that with that link. You can find out all about my creations and what they do along with my personal creations that I am working on and what they're meant to do.
