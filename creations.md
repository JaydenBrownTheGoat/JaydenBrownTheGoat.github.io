# Creation Overview

I haven't made much in my career but I have made a few little knick nacks during my time at Boise State. Such as:
```
MagicSquares: Makes a mathematically correct magic square and can check to see if other magic squares are correct.
LiteBrite: Opens a program where you can effectively use a litebrite which is a tool used for art through lights.
```
those are just a few things that I have made but I have made more during my time at Boise State University.
